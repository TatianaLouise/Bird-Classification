        <h2>Our Machine Learning Model</h2>
        <p>Our ML model in Hummingbird utilizes cutting-edge algorithms to understand your patterns, preferences, and behaviors, allowing it to provide personalized recommendations and suggestions tailored to your needs.</p>
        <p>Here's how our ML model works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> We gather data from various sources, including user inputs, interactions, and external data feeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> The collected data undergoes preprocessing to clean, normalize, and prepare it for analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> We extract relevant features from the data, which are crucial for training our machine learning algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we train our models on the processed data to learn patterns and make predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Our ML model continuously learns and adapts based on new data and user feedback, ensuring its recommendations remain relevant and up-to-date.</li>
        </ol>
