        <h3>Creation Process</h3>
        <p><strong>Data Exploration and Preparation:</strong><br>
            - Explored the dataset directory structure to understand the organization of the data.<br>
            - Loaded the class names by extracting directory names from the training dataset.<br>
            - Visualized random images from different classes to get an understanding of the data.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong><br>
            - Loaded and processed images, including resizing and rescaling.<br>
            - Created data generators using ImageDataGenerator to load images from directories and apply data augmentation techniques like rescaling.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Model Architecture:</strong><br>
            - Utilized the pre-trained model InceptionResNetV2 as the base model for feature extraction.<br>
            - Froze the base model's layers to prevent them from being trained again.<br>
            - Added a global average pooling layer to reduce the spatial dimensions of the features.<br>
            - Added a dense output layer with softmax activation for classification.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Model Compilation and Training:</strong><br>
            - Compiled the model with Adam optimizer.<br>
            - Fit the model for training, specifying training and defined number of epochs.<br>
            - Evaluated the model performance on the test data.<br>
            - Saved the trained model in the native Keras format for future use.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Model Loading and Prediction:</strong><br>
            - Loaded the saved model using TensorFlow/Keras.<br>
            - Defined a function to predict and plot a single image using the loaded model.
        </p>
        <p>Overall, this CNN model was created by leveraging transfer learning with a pre-trained InceptionV3 model, followed by fine-tuning on the specific dataset. Data augmentation techniques were applied during training to improve model generalization, and the final model was saved for deployment and future use.</p>
